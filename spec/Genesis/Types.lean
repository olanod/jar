  Genesis Protocol — Core Types

  ## Source of Truth

  The sole input is the git commit history of master (force-push disabled).

  ## Reward Model

  Rewards are only calculated on signed commits (by GitHub merge or bot GPG key).

  ## Spec Consistency Rule

  For commit N, any spec version ≥ the spec at commit N-1 must produce the
  same CommitIndex. The spec is backward compatible but NOT necessarily
  forward compatible — older spec versions may not handle newer commits
  (e.g., they lack support for new fields like prCreatedAt).

  In practice: the current spec on master evaluates ALL past commits correctly.
  Spec changes MUST preserve results for all already-scored commits. This is
  enforced by CI (`cargo run -p jar-genesis -- replay --mode verify`).

  Each evaluation produces a list of non-negative, capped balance deltas:
    (+contributor_reward, +reviewer1_reward, +reviewer2_reward, ...)

  Final balance for any contributor = Σ of all their deltas across history.

  ## Scoring Model

  Reviewers rank N past commits + the current PR on three dimensions
  (difficulty, novelty, designQuality). Rankings are constrained —
  inflating one requires deflating another, making bias visible.

  Meta-reviews (thumbs up/down) filter low-quality reviews before scoring.
  Score is derived from the weighted lower-quantile of implied scores,
  providing BFT-like safety up to 66% honest weight.

  Guardrails:
  - No delta can be negative (no transfers/slashing).
  - Contributor reward per commit is capped.
  - Reviewer reward per commit is capped.
  - Worst-case damage from a malicious spec = one commit's capped rewards.
  - Comparison targets are validated at spec time — forged targets → zero reward.

  ## Variant System

  Protocol parameters are grouped in GenesisConfig. The active config is
  selected by epoch via a schedule (genesisSchedule), following the
  blockchain hard-fork pattern. Parameter changes are non-retroactive:
  PRs opened before the activation use the old config.

  GenesisVariant extends GenesisConfig with variant-specific functions
  (like JamVariant extends JamConfig in the JAR spec).
