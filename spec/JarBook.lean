JAR is a blockchain protocol based on JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine). This document describes the `jar1` variant — the latest protocol version. The `jar1` variant extends the Gray Paper's PVM with a capability-based execution model (JAVM): multi-VM kernel with synchronous CALL/REPLY and seL4-style capabilities for memory, code, and VM ownership. It also replaces the token-based economy with a coinless quota system. Earlier variants (`gp072\_full`, `gp072\_tiny`) are preserved for conformance testing but not documented here.
