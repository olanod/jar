#doc (Manual) "Accumulation" =>

The accumulation pipeline integrates refined work results into on-chain state
(GP §12). It proceeds in three stages: `accseq` orchestrates sequentially,
`accpar` parallelizes across services, and `accone` handles a single service
via JAVM execution with 29 host-call dispatch entries (REPLY at slot 0,
28 protocol capabilities at slots 1–28).

In jar1, accumulation runs through the capability kernel. The kernel's
`runKernel` function executes service code until a protocol cap is invoked,
at which point control returns to the host. The host handles the protocol
operation (storage read/write, transfer, etc.) and calls `resumeProtocolCall`
to continue execution. Host-call numbering in jar1 is 1-28 (protocol cap slots),
not 0-27 as in gp072. See the *Capability Kernel* chapter for the execution model.

# Host Calls (§12.4)

All 29 host-call handlers (REPLY at slot 0, protocol caps at slots 1–28) are
dispatched by `handleHostCall`. Each protocol cap costs a base gas of 10.
Operations include reading/writing service storage, transferring balance,
managing preimages, and creating or upgrading services.
