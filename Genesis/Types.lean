  Genesis Protocol — Core Types

  ## Source of Truth

  The sole input is the git commit history of master (force-push disabled).

  ## Reward Model

  Rewards are only calculated on signed commits (by GitHub merge or bot GPG key).
  For each signed commit, the reward spec from the PREVIOUS signed commit is
  checked out and applied to the current commit. This means a malicious spec
  change cannot affect its own reward — only the next signed commit's evaluation.

  Each evaluation produces a list of non-negative, capped balance deltas:
    (+contributor_reward, +reviewer1_reward, +reviewer2_reward, ...)

  Final balance for any contributor = Σ of all their deltas across history.

  ## Scoring Model

  Reviewers rank N past commits + the current PR on three dimensions
  (difficulty, novelty, designQuality). Rankings are constrained —
  inflating one requires deflating another, making bias visible.

  Meta-reviews (thumbs up/down) filter low-quality reviews before scoring.
  Score is derived from the weighted lower-quantile of implied scores,
  providing BFT-like safety up to 66% honest weight.

  Guardrails:
  - No delta can be negative (no transfers/slashing).
  - Contributor reward per commit is capped.
  - Reviewer reward per commit is capped.
  - Worst-case damage from a malicious spec = one commit's capped rewards.
  - Comparison targets are validated at spec time — forged targets → zero reward.
