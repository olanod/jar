# Grey

A JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) blockchain node implementation in Rust, following the [Gray Paper v0.7.2](https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper/releases/download/v0.7.2/graypaper-0.7.2.pdf).

### Conformance Testing

Grey includes a conformance target binary (`grey-conform`) that speaks the JAM fuzz-proto v1 protocol over Unix domain sockets, compatible with [minifuzz](https://github.com/davxy/jam-conformance), Polkajam, and Jamzig fuzzers.

**Status: 101/101 blocks passing** on the `0.7.2/no_forks` trace (tiny config: V=6, C=2, E=12). Grey passes the full conformance block test suite.

```bash
# Quick test: replay trace and show pass/fail per block
python3 scripts/run_conform.py

# Compare state with a reference implementation at any block
python3 scripts/compare_with_ref.py 68

# Dump state at a specific block for debugging
python3 scripts/dump_state.py --block 8
```

See [docs/conformance-testing.md](docs/conformance-testing.md) for the full debugging guide, protocol details, and script reference.

### Known Spec Issues

- [docs/pvm-sbrk.md](docs/pvm-sbrk.md) — Ambiguity in the Gray Paper's `sbrk` definition (`sbrk(0)` is undefined; all implementations use a heap-pointer tracking model)
- [docs/host-call-ordering.md](docs/host-call-ordering.md) — GP requires host calls to read guest memory before privilege checks; memory faults take priority over error sentinels
